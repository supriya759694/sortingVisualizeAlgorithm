#ðŸ”¹ Frontend Developer Intern (Self-Initiated Internship)
# Project: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Live Demo:  https://sorting-visualize-algorithm.vercel.app/

Built an interactive web application to visually demonstrate five fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, and Quick Sort.

Used vanilla JavaScript to implement real-time visual animations that simulate the inner working of each algorithm.

Designed and styled a clean, responsive user interface using HTML and CSS, focusing on beginner-friendly interaction and clarity.

Deployed the project on Vercel as a part of a self-initiated internship to simulate a real-world development cycle including UI, logic, and deployment.

Enhanced understanding of algorithm design, DOM manipulation, and state visualization, while improving frontend development skills.
